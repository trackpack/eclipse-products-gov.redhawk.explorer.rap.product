The following steps are necessary to run the SCA Explorer as a RAP application in a JEE web container,
such as Tomcat:

1. Place the required jacorb jar files in a directory on the system bootloader classpath
	+ JAR files to be placed (from plugin org.jacorb.systemFragment): jacorb-services.jar, jacorb.jar
	   slf4j-api-1.6.4.jar, slf4j-jdk14-1.6.4.jar
	+ Where to place them: ${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/ext
2. Ensure that the plugin org.jacorb.systemFragment is NOT deployed with the RAP application
3. Set the required jacorb properties in the RAP application's launch.ini file. These properties will be detected
    by the RAP application as bundle context properties. These are not java properties, so do not prefix them with -D
    + org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass=org.jacorb.orb.ORB
    + org.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass=org.jacorb.orb.ORBSingleton
4. In the RAP application's EntryPoint implementation, before running the workbench, read the jacorb properties
    from the bundle context and set them as system properties
5. Tomcat seems to run out of PermGen space soon after launching the SCA Explorer RAP with the defualt PermGen settings.
   A setting of 256 MB seems to work adequately. Set it by creating the file $CATALINA_HOME/bin/setenv.sh with
   the following content: export CATALINA_OPTS="-server -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
