The following steps are necessary to run the SCA Explorer as a RAP application in a JEE web container,
such as Tomcat:

1. Place the required jacorb jar files in a directory on the system bootloader classpath
	+ JAR files to be placed (from plugin org.jacorb.systemFragment): jacorb-services.jar, jacorb.jar
	   slf4j-api-1.6.4.jar, slf4j-jdk14-1.6.4.jar
	+ Where to place them: ${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/ext
2. Ensure that the plugin org.jacorb.systemFragment is NOT deployed with the RAP application (Default setting in WAR Config.launch)
3. Set the required jacorb properties in the RAP application's launch.ini file. These properties will be detected
    by the RAP application as bundle context properties. These are not java properties, so do not prefix them with -D
    (Will happen automatically if you use the Warproducts configuration in this project)
    + org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass=org.jacorb.orb.ORB
    + org.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass=org.jacorb.orb.ORBSingleton
4. In the RAP application's EntryPoint implementation, before running the workbench, read the jacorb properties
	(Already implemented in this entry point project)
    from the bundle context and set them as system properties
5. Tomcat seems to run out of PermGen space soon after launching the SCA Explorer RAP with the default PermGen settings.
   A setting of 256 MB seems to work adequately. You also need to tell Tomcat to prefer the IPv4 protocol stack, and set
   some properties for logging and JACORB configuration.
   To make these settings,copy the contents of root/setenv.sh in this project to
   $CATALINA_HOME/bin/setenv.sh (create the file if it does not exist)
   You can also specify a value for property gov.redhawk.ui.singleDomain here
6. For logging and JACORB configuration, copy the contents of root/configuration to $CATALINA_HOME/conf
